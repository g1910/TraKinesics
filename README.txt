The project is contained in the folder TraKinesics_CSL404. It contains the following items:
1. dist folder containing the executable file.
	1.1. TraKinesics.exe
2. src folder containing the source code.
	2.1 TraKinesics-1 
	2.2 TraKinesics-2 
3. README.txt
4. Report.pdf
______________________________________________________________________________________________
HOW TO RUN:


		STEP1     open the directory   'dist'


		STEP2     RUn the executable 'TraKinesics.exe'

			Note: This executable is created from source code implementing  a few inbuilt MATLAB functions due to performance considerations.
			
			To separately run the implementations:
			
			1. In the src folder, the folder TraKinesics-1 contains implementation using few MATLAB functions. Run the file Trakinesics.m present in this folder to run this implementation.
			
			2. In the src folder, the folder TraKinesics-2 contains implementation using our own defined functions. Run the file Trakinesics.m present in this folder to run this implementation.

		After step2 an interface will be provided to the user 	
		To start checking the program click on the start button and use stop button from the interface to stop the program.


HOW TO USE/CHECK


	after start of the program the user is given three previews to guide further.
	
	In the left bottom preview the black region shows the clear background.
	Use the clear background for efficient working of the program.

	EVENTS and corresponding Gestures
________________________________________________________________________________________________

	1. SIMPLE MOVING of the MOUSE pointer	
		
	GESTURE:: Keep the two fingers pointing upwards in the clear background ( black region in the preview ) and move
		  in the direction where the mouse is to be moved.




	2. SINGLE left click
		
		GESTURE : close one of the two upward pointing fingers for a sufficient short duration to achieve single right click.


	3. DOUBLE click

		GESTURE : close both the fingers  and open them for very short duration.

	
	4. DRAG
		GESTURE : With two fingers pointing upwards close one of the fingers and move the other finger to perform the drag operation.
